# Rimworld Computers

I think something like OpenComputers in minecraft would be cool but I don't know what you would want it doing - there's not a ton that I can think of
On the other hand, I think having the ability to build semi-custom 'rigs' to assist research, for learning, or for recreation could be interesting
## Existing mods that I've seen
- Rimputer - computers are a building like a toolbench or filing cabinet that increases research speed - looks like it hasn't been updated for 1.6 either
- Computers not Junk - Basically turns the ancient computers into recreation and research stations
- Whaleys Computers - build stations for additional recreation

## Thoughts for mod functions

### Rimtel Computer Corp.
This would be somewhere between Whaley's and Rimputer 
- Build computer stations that improve research speed, recreation, or learning
- Build laptops that improve research speed or hacking efficiency and can be carried around as gear
- Customize higher end computers with additional graphics (recreation) or processing (research) components
- Produce games or learning materials that can be used or sold
- [LT] AR headsets that improve other skills (shooting, construction, etc.)



### Open Rimputers
Closer to what OpenComputers does for minecraft. I think this is a cool concept but I don't see as many use cases right now.
Also has a pretty big tech requirement of being able to inject and execute additional code inside the game - no guarante
