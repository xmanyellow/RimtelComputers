  <!--
    Adopted from Mod Manager, these next two settings are used by both vanilla and Mod Manager
    to alert the player of incorrect mod load order, and wire up the auto-sort button

    It is better to put the mod dependencies and mod load order here in About.xml, and not repeat them in Manifest.xml
    Duplicate code creates opportunity to change one but not the other, and the fewer opportunities for trouble to arise the better.
